# Data Directory

Place your VTT (WebVTT) subtitle files and corresponding WAV audio files in this directory.

Files should have the same base name, with different extensions:
- `example.vtt` - Subtitle file with timestamps and text
- `example.wav` - Corresponding audio file

You can override this directory using the `-i` or `--input-dir` command-line option.
